# README

Source content for my blog about computer networking. The blog can be found at https://www.aidanhouck.github.io

Note that everything is (for now) written in raw HTML, CSS, and basic JS. This may change later, but gemfile dependencies are not fun. 

## Development

Included is a (very) basic python script to locally host so that CORS and absolute paths work properly.
```py
./localhost.py
```
